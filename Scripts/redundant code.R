#there are still multiple occurences of either plz or bfs number. I need to create two versions of this set:
#one that has unique plz numbers, so I can merge it with the sbb dataset, and one that has unique bfs numbers,
#so I can merge it with the bfs dataset. To do this, I need to group by the two variables and set summarize functions
#on what to do with the contents of each column that gets merged.

#now let's check whether the new topo datasets have the same number of unique PLZs/BFS numbers as the SBB/BFS dataset:
n_distinct(topo_plz$PLZ)
n_distinct(sbb$PLZ)
#the topo_plz and sbb datasets each have 3194 unique PLZs, so I can merge them.

n_distinct(topo_bfsn$Gemeindecode)
n_distinct(bfsr$Gemeindecode)
#the topo_bfsn dataset has 2148 unique BFS numbers, but the bfsr dataset has 2440 unique one. I don't know where
#the difference comes from, but I will merge them anyway and see what happens. Maybe I can find out where the
#difference comes from later.
